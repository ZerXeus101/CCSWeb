                      In line with the Commission on Higher Education’s impetus to control the number of Information Technology Education degrees and to centralize its offering within the institution, Silliman University created the College of Information Technology and Computer Sciences. The College became fully operational in June 2001, with Engr. Ang as its Acting Dean.  In August 2006, the College was renamed to what is now known as the College of Computer Studies (CCS).  Following the untimely demise of its Acting Dean in September 2006, Dr. Dave E. Marcial was appointed Dean in June 2007.  Dr. Marcial served as College Dean until May 2020.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The two degree offerings of the College in 2001 were the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) and Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS).  In the following year, the College offered the Bachelor of Science in Information Management (BSIM), now known as the Bachelor of Science in Information Systems (BSIS) program.  The Bachelor of Library and Information Science (BLIS) program was transferred to the College effective June 2017.  The Master in Information Systems (MIS) graduate degree program was implemented to prepare students for industrial practice in project management, information systems planning, design development and management of technical personnel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      To guarantee that effective degrees are offered with appropriate courses and competent methods, the College had the BSIT degree accredited in May 2004 by the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU).  It was granted Level 1 status.  The Federation of Accrediting Agencies of the Philippines (FAAP) granted Level II Re-Accredited Status to the Information Technology, Computer Science and Information Systems programs of CCS for having satisfactorily met the standards and fulfilled all the requirements of (PAASCU).  Such distinction was awarded last February 2016 and is valid until December 2020.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) has granted the College the distinction as Center of Development (COD) in Information Technology Education from 2007 to 2011. In January 2016, CHED has granted the College the distinction as Center of Excellence (COE) in Information Technology Education.

                      One laboratory that challenges students to innovate, nurture mistakes and transform them into an opportunity to learn and create an impact in the community is the vision of the Apps Incubation and Development Laboratory located at the Uytengsu Foundation Computer Center. The Apps Lab is among the first in the country geared towards empowering the youth to think with their creativity in putting what can initially be “bold” and “wild” ideas into mobile iOS applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      To handle the Online Distance Learning (ODL) initiatives of the University, the Educational Technology (EdTech) Department was created under the College.  The main impetus of the EdTech Department is the administration of the learning management system named Silliman Online University Learning (SOUL).  In May 2020, the EdTech Department has now moved as the Office of SOUL.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      To date, the College continues to service the computer-related courses of the other Colleges in the University.
